## Introduction

GitHub typically displays a repository's commit history in chronological order, starting with the most recent commits. However, there are instances when users may need to review the initial commits of a project to gain a better understanding of its evolutionary process. This is where the project comes into play.

## Features

- Automatically navigate to the last page of commit history.
- Display commit timestamps from top to bottom, in descending order from old to new.
- Add `target="_blank"` to commit records.
