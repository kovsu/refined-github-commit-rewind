# Refined Github Commit Rewind

A tampermonkey extension designed for use with GitHub, allowing users to view a repository's commit history in reverse order.

[简体中文](./README_CN.md)

## Introduction

GitHub typically displays a repository's commit history in chronological order, starting with the most recent commits. However, there are instances when users may need to review the initial commits of a project to gain a better understanding of its evolutionary process. This is where the project comes into play.

We offers a simple yet powerful feature that enables users to begin browsing a repository's history from the very first commit.

## How to Use

1. Ensure that your browser's Tampermonkey plugin is installed.
2. Visit [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/) and search for "Refined Github Commit Rewind."
3. Click on the "Install" button.

## Additional Information

This extension does not collect users' personal data or interact with GitHub accounts.
